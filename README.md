# CTR_Prediction
Click-through prediction systems are important because they are widely used for sponsored search and RTB(real Time Bidding). In definition, CTS is the ratio of users who click on the ad to the total number of people who view the page/ad/email or advertisement.

Many ads are actually sold on a pay-per-click basis, meaning the company only pays for ad clicks, not ad views. Thus your optimal approach(as a search engine) is actually to choose an ad based on 'expected value", meaning the price of a click times the likelihood that the ad will be clicked. In other words , a $1 ad with a 5% probability of being clicked has an expected value of $0.05, whereas a $2 ad with 1%probability of being clicked has an expected value of only $0.02. In this case, you would choose to display the first ad.
